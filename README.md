# sealevel-notebook

Several notebooks for analysing tide measurement data. Sources are:
- University of Hawaii, http://uhslc.soest.hawaii.edu/data/
- British Oceanographic Data Centre, https://www.bodc.ac.uk/
- Center for Operational Oceanographic Products and Services, https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/
- Permanent Service of Mean Sea Level (PSMSL), http://www.psmsl.org/


The most exhaustive data set is in the PSMSL notebook (SeaLevel_psmsl.ipynb). It includes 1490 tide gauges worldwide.

The notebook SeaLevel_tideData.ipynb provides everything to create the data sets for the sea level visualization. The notebook SeaLevel_contextData.ipynb creates the data sets needed for the data explorer.
